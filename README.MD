# Estimates Net Worth Based on Current Growth Rate.
A small COBOL program that estimates one's net worth at a current point in their life based on the current growth rate of their assets. 

## Installation
This project has an executable file that can be ran from the command line. You should be able to get it to run so long as you extract all the files into the same folder and the run file.

## Usage

```bash
C:\ .\P1.exe
```

Simply run the executable like you would any other file from the Windows terminal / CMD and the program should start.

I.E. Have fun, but it's your problem if you break it.
